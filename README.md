# Algorythme-g-n-tique-et-r-seau-de-neurone

Application can be use as an aspirator

make move a circle into a labyrinth, if it touch wall it die, if one go to far, all other imitates it by taking its parameters, it move thank to his laser who give euclidean distances and the neural network. Changing parameters of the rnn from (the genetic algorythm who's, "other imitated" 


entries: 5 lasers for detect wall <br>
deplacement: accelerate or no and turn left or right<br>
Rnn : 5 entries, 25:15:3<br>
Output 3: accelerates, turn left or right
biais and weight uniform -2; 2
activation sigmoid<br>

genetic: modify x% of gene randomly by contribution of the first of the generation<br>
fitness: checkpoint who give 500 pts + distance max
